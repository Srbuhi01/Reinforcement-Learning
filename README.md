Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

Key concepts in RL include:

Agent – The decision-maker.
Environment – The system in which the agent operates.
Actions – The choices available to the agent.
Rewards – Feedback received for actions taken.
Policy – The strategy that determines the agent’s actions.
Exploration vs. Exploitation – The balance between trying new actions and choosing the best-known action.

RL techniques are used in robotics, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, DQN), recommendation systems, and autonomous systems.
